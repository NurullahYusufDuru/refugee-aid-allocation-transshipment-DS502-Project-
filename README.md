# Refugee Aid Allocation with Lateral Transshipment

## Project Overview

This project reproduces and extends the model proposed in:

Azizi et al. (2021)  
"Aid Allocation for Camp-Based and Urban Refugees with Uncertain Demand and Replenishments"

The original paper develops a centralized inventory allocation model under demand and replenishment uncertainty.

This project:

1. Replicates the piecewise linear MILP formulation.
2. Extends the model by incorporating lateral transshipment between camps.
3. Solves small-scale instances using Gurobi.
